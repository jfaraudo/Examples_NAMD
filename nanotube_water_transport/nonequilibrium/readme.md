Example of simulation of water flow across the CNT under external pressure difference

The pressure difference between the two ends of the CNT is created by an external force applied as a TCL force.
See here for a tutorial/introduction to the use of external forces in NAMD:
https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/science/forces/forces-tutorial-html/node2.html

The value fo the external force is specified in NAMD units of kcal/mol*Angstrom.
