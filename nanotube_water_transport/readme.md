Example of simulation of water transport accross a carbot nanotube with NAMD

Includes:

-Building of the system from scratch (see build folder)
-Example equilibration run
-Example equilibrium long run (400 ns)
-Example nonequilibrium run: flow under applied external pressure difference

This example is roughly based on the official Nanotechnology tutorial of NAMD
