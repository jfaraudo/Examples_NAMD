# Examples_NAMD
Examples of NAMD simulations, execution and analysis.

## List of Examples

- MD_nanoparticle:
Files corresponding to a simple model of a 2 nm nanoparticle (atoms modelled as LJ potentials with parameters corresponding to gold)

- protein:
Files corresponding to an example simulation of the human ubiquitin protein (PDB code: 1UBQ) generated from experimental data

- nanotube:
Files corresponding to the simulation of water flow across a carbon nanotube

- membrane:
A bilayer membrane made with DPPC phospholipid hydrated with TIP3P water
